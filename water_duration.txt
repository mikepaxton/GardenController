How the watering_duration_countdown works in the control_relay() function works.

The watering_duration_countdown list is a separate list that keeps track of the remaining watering duration for each garden bed (relay) individually. When a garden bed is activated for watering (either manually or according to the watering schedule), the corresponding element in the watering_duration_countdown list is set to the specified watering duration in seconds for that garden bed. This allows multiple garden beds to be watered concurrently, and each garden bed will have its own independent countdown for the watering duration.

In the loop inside the control_relays() function, the for i, button_state in enumerate(buttons): loop iterates over all the garden beds (relays), and the variable i represents the index of the current garden bed in the buttons and relays lists. The code uses this index i to access the corresponding element in the watering_duration_countdown list for that garden bed.

For example, if i is 0, watering_duration_countdown[0] will represent the remaining watering duration for the first garden bed (relay), and if i is 1, watering_duration_countdown[1] will represent the remaining watering duration for the second garden bed (relay), and so on.

Each garden bed's watering duration countdown is independent of the others, and this allows the code to handle multiple garden beds watering at the same time without interfering with one another.

By using the index i, we can easily keep track of each garden bed's watering duration countdown, making the watering control system work correctly for all the garden beds concurrently.
